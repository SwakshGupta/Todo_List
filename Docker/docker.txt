1. So basically docker provide us with a container where we can keep our code  say we were using a perticualr version of 
node js and we have stored every bit of code inside that container

2. Now if we want to share the code different user we can just this container with him and code with same configuration as previous 
will be installed inside the user machine 

3. We can pull our docker command inside the docker registry and later we can pull everything from this docker registry

4. In short, Docker makes it easier to develop, share, and run applications by packaging them into containers that work consistently across different environments

5. One of the most important aspects of container isolation is that each container interacts with its own, private filesystem; this filesystem is provided by a Docker image. 
An image includes everything needed to run an application â€” the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.

6. Each application runs separately from the other. 
Docker solves the dependency problem by keeping the dependency contained inside the containers. 
It unites developers against dependency of their project

## docker image includes everything needed to run an applicaiton (means which operating system etc)

## Ubuntu:

Ubuntu is a popular, open-source operating system based on Linux. 
It's designed to be user-friendly, secure, and versatile, making it suitable for desktops, servers, and other devices.



FUNCTIONING OF DOCKER ....................

Here i have written a  code to create a docker file  for a simple node server having index.js file 


1. FROM node:latest  (This coplede tell us the base image means we have to tell the run enviroment)

2. COPY index.js /home/app/index.js (we have copied our index.js file in our container index.js file)

3.  WORKDIR /home/app/ (here we have changed to our working directory)

4.  RUN npm install ( since we hav'nt copied the node modules so to install them )

5. EXPOSE PORT ( if we run the app then app will run only in the docker container  so to expose it outside we run this EXPOSE no. of port )

6.  CMD["node","index"] (here we have running the command node index.js )


Now lets build the docker 

docker build -t todo . (docker build is the command -t is tag and todo is the name of image dot means the docker file is in same directory )
