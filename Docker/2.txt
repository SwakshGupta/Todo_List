.............................PORT MAPPING............................

1. Docker containers are isolated so if our application is running on port 8000 then it will not render in browser 
with port 8000

2. For that we have to expose the port to outer enviroment 

3. To expose the port we use the commmand docker run -it -p 6000:8000  it means expose the port 8000 with the machine port 6000

so from now own we can run our docker application in browser using the port 6000

4. so we create image and  run on the container then we push that image so that other users can use that image to
run on a container 

5. We write everything on the dockerfile then we convert that file into image [ docker built -t (image_name) ]

we can set any image name inside the docker 

6. now to run this image in a container we use the command 

docker run -it (image_name)  it will  create a new container for that docker image but before starting a container do 
the port mapping first 

7. docker run -it -p 8000:8000 (image_name) to run that image 

8. if you have updated your code and want to update the docker file then run same commmand 

docker built -t (image_name)
