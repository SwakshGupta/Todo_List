Now we create layers in our docker file 

1. Order of those files actually matter because if any layer which is not changing after a perticular change in the code 

2. is kept below the layer which actually changes then by default both layer will work since the first layer was below the second

3. This can consume time while creating a docker file so to avoid that we look at mounting of these layeres carefully 


...............................Docker compose file .....................................

1. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. 
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.


2. create the docker-compose.yml this file will contains all the services and volume required by your project 

3. docker-compose up --build  

Build the images for the frontend and backend services if they don't already exist.
Create and start the containers for both services.

4. docker-compose down

This command will stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
