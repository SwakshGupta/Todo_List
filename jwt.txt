Cookies:

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the browser on the user's computer. 
They are used to remember information about the user between page loads or visits.

Purpose: Track user sessions, remember preferences, store login credentials, etc.

Storage: Stored on the client's browser.
Security: Can be made secure by using flags like HttpOnly


Tokens:

Tokens are data structures used to authenticate and authorize users. 
They are often used in modern web applications, especially in stateless authentication mechanisms.

Purpose: Authenticate and authorize users without storing session data on the server.
Storage: Can be stored in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies on the client's browser.


JWT tokens (JSON Web Token )

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a type of token used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
They are widely used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications.

Structure of a JWT:


A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (.):

Header: Contains the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256, RSA).
Payload: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
Signature: Used to verify the token's integrity and authenticity.

How does the JWT tokens works :

1. After the user credentials a token is generated 

2. after generation it is stored in the local storage or the cookies

3. Then the token is authenticated based on this user is denied or acccepted by the server 


Conclusion:

JWTs are a powerful and flexible method for implementing authentication and authorization in web applications. 
They provide a stateless, scalable, and secure way to manage user sessions, especially in distributed systems and single-page applications. 
By understanding cookies, tokens, and the specific advantages of JWTs, you can choose the best authentication strategy for your application.
