2.RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

3.RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

6. SQl basically consist of commadns in english like this  SELECT * FROM Customers; -- this commands means select all the records from the customer table

7. To select the data we use Select command  (SELECT customername FROM customer) here customer name is the field and customer is the name of the database

8. if we want to return all the columns in the customer table then we can use the (SELECT * ) command

10. SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE Country='Mexico';  customer is the table name and mexico is the column name 

11. SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
