.................................................. SQL DATABASE..........................................

1.  TO create the database here is the command (CREATE DATABASE databasename;)

2.  To drop the database use the command (DROP DATABASE databasename;)

3. To create a table in the database use hte command (CREATE TABLE table_name) then you have to mention all the columns 

4. The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

5. ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255); this command will add a email column in the customer table

6. ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email; this command is use to drop the  column email  // read from the w3 school website for more commands

7.NOT NULL command can be use to if you dont want the field to remain empty 

8. Unique command if you want to fill unique items in that columns 

............................PRIMARY KEY......................................

1. The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

2. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, 
this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

3. In SQL databases, a primary key is a fundamental concept used to uniquely identify each record in a table.

4. In some cases, you might use a composite primary key, which consists of multiple columns like  PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)

5. ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP PRIMARY KEY; this will drop the primary key column

.........................FORGRIN KEY..................................................

1. The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

2. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

3. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

4. CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

 here we have created a table Orders with primary key and Forgein key which refers to the person table 

 5. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, 
 because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.

 6. CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
 customer table has a primary key customer_id and  order table has a forgien key customer_id which is pointing to the customer_id of the original table
