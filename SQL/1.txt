1. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 

It is designed to handle structured data, which consists of data stored in tables with rows and columns. 

SQL provides a way to query, update, and manage data in a database, making it an essential tool for database administrators, developers, and data analysts.


2. So sql is a langauge through which we can communicate with our database and can make changes by typing keywords 


Docker with postgreSQL.............

# Run the PostgreSQL container (you already did this)
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=slogar123 -d postgres

# Access the bash shell in the running container
docker exec -it some-postgres bash

# Switch to the postgres user
su - postgres

# Connect to the PostgreSQL instance using psql
psql

postgreSQL...........................


\l to check all the databases and \q to exit the databases

1.  CREATE DATABASE (name of the database)

2. /c (name of database) to checl whether the database is connected to the postgreSQL

3. /! cls to clear the terminal

4. To createa a table in the database CREATE TABLE (name of database) (

now fill the column name of the table with every column name filled  type , and then enter
when all the columns filled write a semicolon to stop the process of filling 

5.  age INT,
    dob DATE,
    name VARCHAR(255) );   in this way we have created a table of three column first we have to write the name

    and then write the data type 


6. \dt to display the table 

7. to insert data into the tables we can run  the command  INSERT INTO STUDENTS (name,email,age,data)

8. To check what is inserted in the data base use the command

SELECT * FROM students; (students is the name of databse)

here * implies everything
